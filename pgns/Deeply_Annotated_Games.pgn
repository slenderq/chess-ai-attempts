1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 {the last time Nakamura reached this position was in
2005, against...Mamedayarov, as it happens. That time Nakamura played ...Nf6 in
response. The text move is more testing and less likely to transpose to another
opening.} 3... dxc4 4. e3 b5 5. a4 b4 6. Nce2 {this and Ne4 (the most played in
the database) give this variation independent significance, otherwise the
knight retreats to a2 and b1 are likely to transpose to variations from the
mainline Slav with 5. e3. The text move is extremely rare and one of the two
games in the database was a previous effort by Mameyadrov.} 6... Nf6 {an
obvious developing move which was not played in the other two games in the
database.} (6... Qd5 {is also the standard response to Ne4, but in this
variation it seems counterproductive, as the following game from Mameyadrov
shows.} 7. Ng3 (7. Nf4 {seems very good for White.}) 7... Nf6 8. Be2 e5 9. Nf3

-Brunello,S (2575)Porto Carras 2011}) 7. Nf3 Ba6 {is a common idea in the
variation, assisted in this case by the Ne2 blocking the Bf1.} 8. Ng3 c5 {a
thematic counterblow in the center. Black should be happy to exchange queens on
d1 following dxc5, stranding White's king in the center.} 9. Bd2 {this seems
harmless, but Houdini already shows a half-pawn advantage for Black with the
game continuation.} (9. Ne5 $5) 9... e6 10. Rc1 Qd5 {now White is not in a
position to challenge the queen and the Ng3 looks misplaced.} 11. Ne5 {this
appears weaker now than on move 9, with more of Black's forces already
mobilized.} (11. dxc5 Nbd7 12. Bxb4 Nxc5) 11... cxd4 12. Nxc4 Nbd7 (12... dxe3

tactically from immediate capture, although is not fully immune.} (13. exd4
Qxd4 14. Be2 {would be a simpler way to proceed.}) 13... Rc8 {the solid choice,
among other things avoiding the potential skewer on the h1-a8 diagonal. As
noted below, ...Bxc4 does in fact work, but a good deal of calculation is
required to confirm that.} (13... Qxg2 $2 14. Bf3 {and Black loses material to
the bishop fork.}) (13... Bxc4 14. Bxc4 (14. Rxc4 d3 15. Qc1 {sets a trap, as
Black is too weak on the back rank to take the Be2 immediately, but he can
still defend well.} Rd8 (15... dxe2 $2 16. Rc8+ Rxc8 17. Qxc8+ Ke7 18. Bxb4+)

with Black able to avoid punishment.} 15. Bb5 Rd8 16. Bc6 Qh3 17. exd4 Bd6) 14.

however after} bxa3 16. Rxc5 Nxc5 {the material is more or less balanced, but
Black has too many threats, including .. .Nd3+ and ...a2.}) 15... Be7 (15... d3
$5) 16. Ne2 $6 {the knight returns from its exile on g3, while continuing to
use up White's tempi.} (16. O-O {seems logical.}) 16... d3 {this now gains
another tempo with an attack on the knight.} 17. Nf4 O-O (17... Qc7 { is
Houdini's choice, which would allow Black to defend the b4 pawn after ... Qb8.
Nakamura prefers to play more aggressively and not worry about the pawn.}) 18.
Nxd3 Qf5 {Black has a lead in development, allowing him to initiate threats.
Meanwhile White has not yet castled and his knights continue to be a source of
problems.} 19. e4 $2 {this essentially gives away a pawn.} (19. Nxb4 Bxc4

Black can effectively exploit his open lines and White's lack of piece
coordination, for example} 21. O-O Rfd8 22. c5 Nxf3+ 23. gxf3 {Qxf3 is

of 6. c3.} 6... Bg4 {why the previous move is considered theoretically less
desirable. Normally the bishop has to go to f5 instead.} 7. Be2 e6 8. O-O Qc7 {

as the king has nowhere else to go.} 12. Rd1 {White has tried a lot of things

shutting down Black's play on the g-file. Here are two games where Black

{this is a standard break in the Caro-Kann main line, the idea being to help
activate Black's pieces. With Black castled queenside it requires a little more
bravery.} 13. d5 {White would of course welcome an exchange on d5, leaving
Black with no central pawns and a horrendous pawn structure on the kingside.}

characteristic of the Karlsbad variation. White chooses not to block the Bg2
and normally looks to move the knight to f4.} 6... e6 {an uncommon move here,
although e6 is played in the main line Karlsbad. The pawn move has the dual
purpose of contesting d5 and allowing Black the option of playing an eventual .
..e5 if White pushes d5.} (6... c6 {scores 50 percent in the database and is
the popular choice for those not wanting to commit the knight via ...Nc6.}) 7.

confined, but may have good long-term prospects.} 11. O-O Qe7 12. Qa3 Nbd7 13.

equal, despite the small material imbalance in White's favor. Kamsky must have
been confident that he could exploit his longer-term structural advantages and
White's weaknesses (such as the e-pawn), despite his own backward development.
The collection of pieces on the 8th rank is impressive in that regard.} 21. Bf3

Nd6 {effectively trapping the rook, forcing White to give back the exchange.})

development.}) 4. d4 Bg7 5. e3 Nc6 6. Bb2 Bg4 {breaking from the standard
Sicilian ideas. This move in fact scores quite well for Black, at around 77

position and only one at the professional level.} 7. Be2 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bxe2 9.

strength.} 12... Nh6 13. Nd2 Nf5 14. O-O O-O 15. Nf3 b6 {challenging the head

to an area where she can exercise greater dominance and directly assist the
pawn advance.} 20... d4 {Black attempts to set his own pawns in motion and
obtain counterplay. However, it's interesting to observe that while White has
three pieces lined up in front of Black's pawns to oppose their advance, Black
has none in front of White's.} 21. Nd2 Kg7 22. Ne4 {the knight has multiple
functions here, obviously blockading e4 but also threatening to hop into d6 and
offering support to the c5 pawn.} 22... Rf8 23. c6 {White obviously believes
the dictum that passed pawns must be pushed.} 23... Nh4 {according to Houdini,
the major turning point in the game, which is now evaluated as heavily in
White's favor. Black apparently intended to play f5 as a followup, but that
never actually happens. White's c-pawn is far enough advanced that it becomes a
major force and Black must focus on restraining its progress, as his passed
d-pawn is not nearly as threatening.} (23... Qc7 {seems like the best option,
blockading the pawn.} 24. Rc1 Rab8 {preventing White's queen from going to b7}

round 2 game, White goes for a more standard plan against the Stonewall. The

Bb7 { this development of the light-square bishop is a feature of the Modern
Stonewall and is now more popular than the old transfer of the bishop to h5. On
b7, the bishop appears buried, but serves a useful function supporting the
c-pawn and can spring to life if it advances and pawn exchanges occur in the

seems counterintuitive, but is in fact a common idea in the Stonewall, in part
because White can reposition her other knight to e5 later on. White starts to
have problems in this position if this does not occur, as examined in the
following sample variation. Black has a number of tactical possibilities
lurking, with ideas including using her Nd5 for forks on c3 or f4, along with
the two powerful bishops pointed at White's king.} (16. Rad1 cxd4 17. Bxd4 {

queen pawn opening, White switches to an English continuation.} 3... Bb4 {the
Nimzo-English.} 4. Qc2 {unlike the Nimzo-Indian, where the text move is merely
one option among several major lines, White overwhelmingly chooses Qc2 (and
sometimes Qb3) in the English, to preserve his pawn structure after Bxc3; g3 is
the one popular alternative to this approach.} 4... O-O 5. a3 Bxc3 {otherwise
the bishop move has simply been a loss of time.} 6. Qxc3 b6 7. e3 Bb7 8. b3 {

with b4 grabbing a little more space.} 8... d6 9. Bb2 Nbd7 10. Be2 Nc5 {one of
the differences between this line and the b4 line is that Black has c5

remove her king before initiating action in the center.} 13... Rc8 {the opening

interested in central and kingside play than in the queenside.} 14... Qe7 15.

characteristics of that.} 17... Rfd8 18. Bd4 {this move seems largely designed
to provoke Black's response.} 18... e5 19. Bb2 {the d6/e5 pawn formation is now
weaker and less flexible than the d6/e6 pawn center, especially with the
backwards d6 pawn on the half-open file. It is currently well-guarded, but in
the long run that could be a weakness. The e5 advance more importantly for the
shorter term also creates a hole on d5 which White, if she can, will try to
exploit.} 19... Qe6 {Black recognizes the weakness of d5 and moves to reassert
control over it, also putting the queen in an excellent central location on the
a2-g8 and h3-c8 diagonals.} 20. Rc1 b5 {attempting to force the issue of the

the half-open d-file.} 24... Rb7 25. h3 { apparently intended to prevent ...Ng4

the Bd5 mobility.}) 26. Rfd1 {it's worth observing how White's rooks and other
pieces are working together and are well-placed to apply further pressure,

the idea of supporting the b4 advance.} 9... d6 10. Nc2 a4 {as mentioned during
the live commentary, the idea is to disrupt the b4 advance by taking en passant
on b3, which would prevent White from recapturing with the a3 pawn as normal

again.} 11. Ne3 Nd4 {the knight looks really strong here and White has no good
way to get rid of it in the near term.} 12. d3 {usually this is played earlier,
among other things to free up the Bc1, which is now blocked by the Ne3.} 12...

something more for his development.} 13. Re1 (13. Nxa4 {this pawn snatch

Black's finely posted knight.} 16... Nb3 17. Ne4 Qb6 18. Nd2 f5 19. Nxb3 {White

opening for White as the analagous Catalan against the QGD (without ...c6 being
played)} 6... e6 7. Qb3 {an aggressive move, but one which scores over 56
percent for Black in the database. All of the main continuations favor Black,
showing how the fianchetto line versus the Slav is generally ineffective.} 7...
Qc8 {a rather passive development for the queen.} (7... Qb6 {is the most
popular and should be the easiest road to equality. Exchanging queens on b6
would be fine for Black, as he then would get the half-open a-file and the
doubled b-pawns are not in fact weak.}) 8. Nc3 dxc4 {a novelty in the database.
Black normally continues to maintain the tension in the center and have the
extra control over e4. The text move leads to a looser continuation by Black
which is more aggressive and unbalanced.} (8... h6 {is the most played here.})
9. Qxc4 b5 10. Qb3 b4 {the logical follow-up. Now that Black has chosen this
aggressive line which also weakens his queenside, he needs to keep hitting
White's pieces to disrupt his opponent and keep him off-balance.} 11. Na4 (11.

to worry about the pawn.} 14. Rfe1 Be4 15. Qb3 { White accepts the idea of a

often played is ...f6, which is solid and scores about 50%.} 11. a3 Bf6 12. Nd2

simply not known how to best handle the position, which is equal but easier to
play as White.} 12... Kh8 (12... Be7 {would be difficult to play, given that
the bishop had just moved, but it would effectively combat White's next
ideas.}) 13. b4 { now out of the database. This simple pawn thrust proves
highly effective in gaining White space and causing Black some annoying
problems.} 13... Rb8 {this is an understandable reaction to the latent threat
on the long diagonal from the Bg2. The rook moves out of the potential pin and
protects the b7 pawn, which will allow the Nc6 to move when attacked without
losing the pawn. However, this also allows White the initiative and a slight
plus.} 14. Bc5 $14 Ne7 15. b5 Nbc8 16. a4 {White continues to play naturally,
reinforcing his space gain on the queenside.} 16... b6 17. Ba3 {White's
positional advantage is now obvious to see, with his bishops crisscrossing the
board and Black's pieces relatively awkwardly placed.} 17... Nd6 18. Rc2 {White
chooses to build up on the c-file prior to making a move in the center. This is
prudent but also allows Black to reposition his pieces to better squares in

normal here, followed by additional piece development.} 8... O-O 9. Bb2 Bd7 {
starting the classical bishop maneuver to the kingside. The more modern
development is with ...b6 and Bb7, but with the Ne5 and Bd3 placed where they
are, this method of developing the bishop would appear to be less effective.}

the Stonewall. Here it seems to work in Black's favor, as the central tension

off the Bh2 from the action.} 13... Qf6 14. d5 {necessary to avoid the
pressure, although this simply chases Black's knight to a good square.} 14...

Kosteniuk from earlier this year in May. Black therefore must have had the

White playing the capture and following up with 6. c3, which however is not the
most aggressive continuation.} 6... a6 $146 {a novelty on move 6! However,

played (and also the most theoretical).} 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4
{ Spassky introduced this move into top-level play and made it the standard. It
is an aggressive pawn thrust, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the
bishop's location and White's natural orientation to kingside play in this
variation.} 6... h6 7. Nf3 e6 {a rare move, although Anand himself has played
this, along with the main line ...Nd7 and the alternative ...Nf6. The main line
prevents Ne5 by allowing Black to immediately exchange off the knight, so the
game continuation is the natural reaction.} 8. Ne5 Bh7 {no other square is safe
for the bishop.} 9. Bd3 {exchanging off the bishop is the most popular, also
logical from the standpoint of gaining time, as Black's bishop has made more
moves than White's equivalent and White will be left with more pieces developed
afterwards. Other commentators have also pointed out that Black's attempt to
snatch a pawn with ...Qxd4 fails to 10. Nxf7!} 9... Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nd7 { this
knight needs to be developed sooner or later and challenging Black's Ne5 sooner
is certainly a good idea.} 11. f4 {this is by far the most popular move,
although by no means forced. If White is going to play aggressively with 8.
Ne5, then this continuation makes sense to keep the space advantage on the
kingside. With this move, however, White is essentially committing himself to
castle queenside, as the kingside pawn shield is now almost nonexistent. (See
move 14 notes, however, for a game featuring Anand castling kingside)} 11...

comparison with the main line, White now takes an extra tempo to exchange off
the Bh7. This is a reasonable trade in strategic terms, as Black's bishop
occupies an excellent diagonal and its White counterpart is hemmed in by
Black's pawn structure. Although this is one of Houdini's top choices,
according to the database it is a novelty. Presumably White players are
normally looking for something more ambitious in this variation.} 13... Bxd3
14. Qxd3 Nbd7 {we now have a standard-looking Caro-Kann structure from the main
line, the difference being that White has bishop for knight. While this may
provide a slight edge, it is worth noting that White's knights can be effective
attackers in the main line, especially when targeting e6/f7, which is not
possible here due to the absence of both the light-square bishop and a suitably
placed knight.} 15. Rfd1 Re8 16. c4 Qa5 {the idea being to restrain b4 and
develop the queen to a more useful square. Also worth noting is how the queen
exerts lateral force along the fifth rank, especially against the h-pawn,

normally tries to avoid trading off the dark-square bishop, given his weakness

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 d5 {the QGD setup against the English can result in a
number of different kinds of games. Here White is already committed to a
kingside fianchetto, rather than central play.} 4. Bg2 dxc4 {this scores the
best of Black's possibilities here, with around 52 percent for White.
Completing the QGD setup with ...Be7 is the most popular choice, however.} 5.

the rook off the long diagonal and overprotects b7.}) 8. d3 (8. a4 {immediately

however, as Black prefers to focus on development rather than taking the
opportunity to push the b-pawn in the interim.}) 8... Be7 {the bishop often is
developed instead to d6 in this line.} 9. Nc3 O-O 10. a4 Nb6 $146 {White has
won the handful of previous games with this position in the database, so
perhaps Black trying something new is warranted.} (10... Qc7 $5 {would pursue
more standard development and makes sense to support the c-pawn, as well as
putting another piece in place to influence the e5 square.}) 11. O-O Nbd5 12.

positions where ...a6 will be inevitably played at some point, so throwing it
in this early appears artificial. White scores a healthy 60 percent from this
position.} 5. d4 {transposing to a Catalan where Black's previous move
definitely looks strange. However, the point is that White cannot automatically
regain the pawn after the capture on c4, as ...b5 is now possible.} 5... dxc4

gambit, but now White is playing it as such.} 6... Nc6 7. Nbd2 {not the most

own knight in the center.} 9... O-O 10. Be3 {developing a piece and maintaining
pressure in the center, temporarily pinning the knight against the hanging Bc5.
Interestingly, Houdini already gives a small plus to White, meaning she has
more than enough compensation for the pawn.} 10... Ba7 {protecting the bishop
in the best way, although it still looks awkward.} 11. Rc1 $14 {What does White
have for the pawn? The Ne5 is excellently placed and cannot be easily driven
off. The Nc4 is also strong and can be routed to c6 if Black plays ...b5.
White's Bg2 also looks excellent, while its counterpart is doing nothing on c8
and will be a pain to develop. Finally, the half-open c-file is already
occupied by a White rook.} 11... c5 {Black attempts to play as actively as
possible and supports the d4 outpost.} 12. Bd2 {White judges that the bishop
has no future on the g1-a7 diagonal and prepares to reroute it. This also
clears the square for the e-pawn to kick the Nd4.} 12... Nd5 {besides
centralizing the knight, this blocks the long diagonal and potentially will
assist Black in developing the queenside.} 13. e3 Nb5 14. Qe2 {while this
develops the queen to a useful square, the main effect is to clear d1 to
develop the other rook.} 14... Nd6 {Black looks to start some exchanges, in the
hopes of trading away White's advantages. } 15. Rfd1 Nxc4 16. Nxc4 (16. Qxc4

wants to avoid a theoretical duel in the Leningrad variation, settling for an
uncommon solid-seeming move rather than the usual c4. The immediate logic is
obvious, to reinforce the d4 strongpoint, but the line is certainly less
challenging to Black. One difference that Black should keep in mind, though, is
that White now has Qb3+ without a pawn blocking the diagonal.} 6... a5 {Black
cheekily answers with an offbeat response of his own. This pawn move seeks to
restrain White's potential follow-up play on the queenside, including b4. Prior
to this game, however, it scored horribly, with no Black wins and White scoring
a similar number of wins and draws.} 7. Nbd2 {the natural square (c3) having
been occupied, White needs to take some extra time to get his knight developed.
From here White may also think about supporting the e4 advance.} 7... Nc6 {when
Black can get away with this knight development in the Leningrad, it's usually
a good idea to play it, since it fights directly for e5. The usual advance d5
here is not playable for White, due to the c-pawn being a square short of its
usual post.} 8. Re1 d5 {a strong central reaction. Black sees that exerting
control over e4 and c4 is more important than any potential resulting pawn
structure weaknesses.} 9. Nb3 {the knight has now taken two moves to get to a

placement, but rather to open the diagonal and support Black's following move.}

rates the position as equal, the fact that Black has been able to consistently

two most popular responses.} 4. e3 {continuing with the standard setup,
although c3 is also possible. Exchanging on c5 would simply give Black what he
wants in the center and develop the dark-squared bishop.} 4... cxd4 {exchanging
the c for the d pawn, which according to classical theory is a plus. Of course
this is done all the time in the Open Sicilian by White, so general ideas only
get you so far.} 5. exd4 b6 {again, the most popular continuation. The
light-squared bishop will otherwise be out of the game.} 6. h3 {a typical
feature of the opening, although played early here. The main point is to
provide a retreat square for the Bf4, rather than to take g4 away from the
Nf6.} 6... Bb7 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Re1 d6 {Black challenges the hold White
has over e5, which otherwise would be an excellent outpost for him.} 10. a4

Bh2 {White anticipates a challenge to the bishop and withdraws it to safer
territory.} 12... Re8 13. a5 { demonstrating a deep understanding of the
position. With this advance on the wing, in fact Kamsky is undermining Black's
position in the center.} 13... d5 {while a central pawn on d5 is not a bad
thing in itself, here the pawn advance gives up the e5 square and also blocks
the Bb7.} (13... bxa5 14. Nc4 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 d5 16. Nxa5 $14) (13... b5 {is
Houdini's preference, which maintains Black's central configuration and makes
fewer concessions to White.} 14. c4 bxc4 15. Nxc4 Qb8) 14. c3 {Kamsky with this
move reinforces d4 and gives his queen (or bishop) the c2 square.} 14... Bc6

its double on a6 a target.}) 15. axb6 Qxb6 16. Ra2 Bb5 17. Bc2 {Kamsky's
decision to avoid the piece trade I believe was influenced by the must-win
nature of the game. He likely assessed that in practical terms, his winning
chances would decrease, even if the position appeared slightly better.} (17.
Qe2 Bxd3 18. Qxd3 $14) 17... Rec8 {the action looks to be over on the
queenside, so Black commits his rook.} 18. Ne5 Nxe5 { leaving the strong knight
on e5 would do Black no good and the piece exchange is also welcomed. However,
White as a result of the maneuver gains more control over the strategic
square.} 19. Bxe5 Nd7 20. Bf4 a5 21. Re3 {the rook lift idea looks a little
crude, but again White needs the win. Black's forces are also away from the
kingside, so there is an intimidation factor to White's potential attack.}
21... Nf8 {a key turning point strategically. Friedel chooses to shift his play
back to the kingside for defense, mirroring Kamsky's efforts, rather than play
on the queenside where he has a space advantage and pressure.} (21... a4 {here
or on the next move is the engine's recommendation, as it assesses that White
will not be able to put together a successful kingside attack.} 22. Ra1 (22.

try to impose his own ideas.} 25. Nf3 Be8 26. Bh2 { again preserving the bishop
and anticipating possible Black tactics with the Be8 now lined up on the Qh5.}
26... f5 27. Nd2 {this clears the h5-d1 diagonal for the queen.} 27... Rf6
{while this reinforces Black's defense on the 6th rank, it hampers his piece
coordination.} 28. Re1 f4 $6 {this loosens Black's position and gives back the
g4 square to White.} (28... Bd6 $5 {looking to exchange pieces.}) 29. Qg4 Bd6
30. Nf3 {the knight can now return to its more active square, since the queen
is safe.} 30... Qc7 31. Kh1 {this looks like a waiting move, as there does not
appear to be a pressing reason to delay Ng5.} 31... Bf7 {still playing
defensively and rather passively.} (31... Rb8 {would provide some counterplay,
or the aforementioned ...a4 idea.}) 32. Ng5 {now White looks to be in control
strategically.} 32... Nf8 {Black has to contort himself even more to cover his
weaknesses, while White feels no pressure.} 33. Nxf7 Kxf7 34. Qf3 Rb8 35. Bg1
{apparently aimed at covering the f2 square, although the engine considers that
Kg1 is a better way to accomplish this. The bishop also eventually provides
support for d4 after the c-pawn is pushed, but locking the piece away in the
meantime seems a high price to pay.} (35. Kg1 Kg8 36. Qd3 $16 ) 35... Kg8 36.
Bd1 {a passive move that follows the previous passive move, meaning that White
has seemingly dissipated much of his pressure. I imagine both players were in
time pressure by this point, which explains the following repetition.} 36...

effective blockading piece for the queenside, leaving the queen available for
other duties.}) 43. Rf1 dxc4 {this transformation of the pawn structure
benefits White more than Black. Again Black gives up a key central square, this
time e4.} 44. bxc4 Rd8 45. Qe4 (45. f3 {is also possible.}) 45... a4 { Black
does not have sufficient support for the a-pawn, while in contrast the c/ d
pawn duo is stronger and has better piece support.} 46. Bg4 $16 {the bishop
finally springs to life again, also clearing the first rank for the rook.} (46.
c5 {played immediately also looks very effective, as Houdini already evaluates
White as being the equivalent of two pawns up.} Bc7 47. f3 Ng6 48. Ra2 $18 {
and the a-pawn will fall.}) 46... a3 47. c5 a2 $2 {this loses material and
seals Black's fate, but perhaps Friedel thought it gave him the best practical
chances, setting a trap if the Bd6 is captured.} (47... Bc7) 48. f3 $18 (48.

although White is only a pawn up, it is a protected passed pawn. Meanwhile, his
pieces are so active and coordinated, and Black's are not, that it is nearly
impossible to imagine any way to save the game against someone like Kamsky.}

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nbd2 {this appears to have been played just to
get Black out of her standard book lines. The move itself is clearly inferior
to Nc3, among other things temporarily blocking the bishop development and
limiting the scope of the knight.} 4... Bf5 {Black continues by developing the
bishop in classic Slav style.} 5. e3 (5. Nh4 {seems to be the a strong choice

would have no problem sacrificing herself by taking the other rook on f1,

formerly standard deployment to f5) is an interesting alternative. The bishop
is harder to exchange off for White and of course pins the knight. However, the
bishop is missed on the h7-b1 diagonal, where it is strong (and one of the
reasons why White normally immediately spends extra time in the opening to
exchange it off).} 5. Qb3 {immediately taking advantage of the bishop's absence

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 5. h3 Bh5 6. cxd5 Bxf3 {the most popular
and best-scoring response. White's queen is diverted to the kingside as a
result, which lessens the impact of the bishop's absence from the queenside.}
7. Qxf3 cxd5 8. Nc3 e6 9. Bd3 Bb4 $146 {...Nc6 is the normal move here. The
dark-square bishop typically goes to e7 or d6 rather than b4.} 10. Bd2 Nc6 11.
O-O O-O 12. Rfd1 Rc8 {a typical Slav middlegame structure is on the board, with
a symmetrical pawn structure and open c-file. White has the two bishops, but
their scope is relatively constrained.} 13. Qe2 Qe7 14. Rac1 Rfd8 15. a3 Ba5
16. b4 Bc7 17. f4 Bd6 {at this point one has to question the wisdom of the
bishop's long journey to d6, when this could have been played directly on move
9. Black shortly will use a pawn lever to break up White's queenside, so
perhaps that was her original strategic concept.} 18. Rb1 Ra8 19. Na4 a5 20.

immediately pressing the chance for a White advantage. Two potential
alternatives:} (20. b5) (20. Nb6) 20... Nxa5 21. Nb6 Ra7 22. a4 Ba3 {taking
advantage of the Q+B battery.} (22... Nc6 $5) 23. Bxa5 {this exchanges a bad
bishop for a knight on the rim. While not a bad idea in the short term, White
does give up the one slim long-term strategic advantage she has.} (23. Rb5 Nc6
24. Rdb1 $14) 23... Rxa5 24. Qd2 Ra7 25. Qc2 Qf8 {keeps the Q+B battery active
while lending the queen's strength to the eigth rank.} 26. Rb3 g6 {breaks the
indirect pin on the Nf6, which otherwise was tied to defending h7. Also
importantly prevents the f5 advance.} 27. Rdb1 Bd6 $11 {White's temporary
pressure has ebbed and Black will be able to easily parry White's further
attempts at activity.} 28. Rc3 Bb4 29. Rc7 Kg7 30. g4 Ba5 31. g5 Ne8 {although
White has a space advantage and a rook sitting on c7 (temporarily), it is
interesting to note the lack of any real threats. The Bd3 is effectively out of
the game due to the pawn structure and the rook cannot do anything with the
c-file.} 32. Rc5 Nd6 33. Qd1 {White apparently does not want to acknowledge her
lack of threats and tries to regroup her pieces. However, this works to Black's
advantage.} 33... Bxb6 34. Rxb6 Rda8 $15 {at this point, Black's knight is
superior to White's bishop and Black's pieces are cooperating much more
effectively than White's.} 35. Rb4 Qe8 36. Bc2 Nc4 {White's lack of piece
coordination, especially with the rooks, is visibly evident.} 37. Kf2 b6 {this
allows White to return to equality.} (37... h6 {is the engine's recommendation
to try for an advantage.} 38. gxh6+ Kxh6 39. Rc7 b6 40. Rxa7 Rxa7 $17 {Black
can now target the isolated h-pawn and penetrate on the kingside with his
queen.}) 38. Rcb5 Qd7 39. Qd3 $6 {this sets up a tactical weakness on the
c-file.} (39. Bd3) 39... Qc7 (39... Rc8 {in return for sacrificing the b-pawn,
Black gains control of the c-file and can penetrate to the back ranks.} 40. Bb3
Nd6 41. Rxb6 Rac7 $19) 40. Bd1 Ra6 {Black decides to concentrate on protecting
the b-pawn and shutting down any White activity rather than unbalancing the
game, evidently not evaluating that it would be clearly to her benefit. Several
possibilites for advantage include:} (40... h6 $5 {this idea would again work
to good effect here.}) (40... Rh8) (40... Rc8) 41. Rb1 Nd6 42. R5b2 Nc4 43. Rb4
R8a7 44. Ke2 Nd6 {the piece shuffling indicates both sides are happy with a

inevitably be traded for a knight, Black would have no problem doing this on e4

on the queenside, with few prospects in the center or on the kingside.} 23...

advanced g-pawn is in fact not that weak and can usefully gain space. Here

standard continuation of c4.} 6... d6 7. Qb3+ {the most popular idea as a
follow-up. White takes advantage of the diagonal being clear.} 7... e6 {this is
something of a concession to White, as Black would prefer to be able to play
e5, but on the positive side the move also reinforces d5, while e6 is no longer
a weak point.} 8. Bg5 {Ng5 is popular here, opening up the long diagonal for
the bishop, as well as the more prosaic Nbd2.} 8... Qe8 $146 {the usual idea
behind this move in the Leningrad is to support an advance of the e-pawn, as
well as give the queen a path to the kingside after g6 is vacated.} (8... Nc6

point is that the pawn advance d5 is not possible at this stage, unlike in the
main line with a pawn on c4.}) 9. Nbd2 Nh5 {Black decides to leave the

the pawn on the kingside and down the f-file.}) 17. gxf5 exf5 {while Black's

on f5 is also difficult to attack and he has prospects on the g-file.} 18. Bf2

reposition itself without risk.} 22. Bh4 {White looks to exchange his "bad"
bishop for one of Black's good knights, but this also will remove a key
dark-square defender from the game.} 22... Ng6 23. Bxf6 Rxf6 24. Rf2 c5 {this
move highlights one of the interesting things about the Dutch, in that Black
has to look at playing on all portions of the board to be most effective, and
not just fixate on the kingside. Black now threatens to push ...c4 and would
welcome the open d-file if the pawn were exchanged.} 25. Raf1 Qe6 26. a3 Rg8

(g- and e-files) and he has firmly taken over the initiative.} 27. Kh1 Kh7 28.

White.} 28... Re8 29. Qd2 Rg8 30. Qe3 {a repetition sequence that no doubt
helped with the time control.} 30... c4 31. Nf4 $6 {this allows Black to solve

nevertheless considered "hot" because of recent high-level games, including

1. Nf3 {While this is often the first move of a Reti Opening, it's also a good
way to be noncommital at the start of the game.} 1... Nf6 {Black obviously
thinks the same way.} 2. c4 e6 {this is now technically an English Opening and
is classified as such, even though White eventually plays d4.} 3. b3 {an
offbeat but perfectly fine and successful (57 percent) opening approach.} 3...
d5 {Black decides to adopt a QGD structure, a solid approach.} 4. Bb2 Be7 5. e3
{the double fianchetto with g3-Bg2 is also popular.} 5... O-O 6. d4 {Nakamura
plays this with the idea of subsequently developing the light-square bishop to
d3, rather than the more conventional e2.} 6... b6 {now Black is going for a
QGD-Tartakower formation by fianchettoing his light-square bishop.} 7. Bd3 Bb7
8. O-O c5 9. Nbd2 (9. Qe2 {is an interesting alternative, freeing up d1 for the
rook and forming a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal.}) (9. Nc3 {used to be played
more often, but at top levels not so much recently.}) 9... Nc6 10. Rc1 Rc8 {
interestingly, up until this point Nakamura is following (intentionally or not)
a successful game of his opponent's (as White) from 2013. Now, as Black, Harika
varies from what her opponent did previously, but she still ends up losing.}
(10... cxd4 {is considered equal by the engine.} 11. exd4 Nh5 12. g3 g6 13. Qe2

(2475)-Khotenashvili,B (2514) Tashkent 2013}) 11. a3 {taking the b4 square away
from the Nc6. Nakamura has an equal position and appears not to want to hurry
with any major plans, but rather see in what direction his opponent wishes to
go.} 11... Re8 {following a similar plan as in the game cited above.} 12. Re1
Bf8 {this is a logical follow-up and presumably aimed at defending the
kingside, but the bishop is obviously less active than it could be elsewhere,
for example on d6. Unlike the above game cited with Harika as White, here she
never plays the freeing ...g6, which is necessary to activate the bishop.} 13.
dxc5 bxc5 14. cxd5 exd5 15. Qc2 h6 (15... g6 {is possible here, and probably
preferable. It blunts the b1-h7 Q+B battery that White has established, while
giving the Bf8 an outlet. Perhaps Black did not like the looks of opening the
long diagonal to White's Bb2.}) 16. Qb1 {this prudently removes the queen from
the c-file while preserving the battery on the diagonal. It also serves as
another waiting move for Nakamura, which works to his advantage.} (16. Bf5 { is
a more conventional approach.}) 16... Nd7 {this does not appear strategically
consistent with the idea of maintaining a strong kingside defensive presence.}
17. Bh7+ Kh8 18. Bf5 {the advantage of this sequence, beyond simply moving to
f5 directly, is that Black's king is slightly more vulnerable and her g-pawn is
pinned, creating some tactical ideas for White.} 18... Rb8 {moving away so the
Nd7 is freed from the pin on the diagonal.} 19. Qa1 { very hypermodern of
Nakamura and an idea associated with the Reti Opening. The queen in the corner
exerts pressure on the center and against Black's king.} 19... Qe7 $6 {one gets
the impression that Black did not know how to proceed in this type of position.
White now immediately takes advantage of this slip.} 20. b4 { threatening to
continue with b5, which would be very awkward for the Nc6. Again the idea is to
dominate the center through indirect means, in this case chasing away a piece
defending e5.} 20... cxb4 21. axb4 a6 {the logical follow-up, preventing b5.
However, now White has other useful things he can do.} 22. Nb3 { the exchanges
have given White a potential strong outpost on c5. Black's d-pawn is also now
isolated and White has the square in front of it (d4) blockaded, making the
pawn weak.} 22... Nde5 (22... Nb6 $5 {would more directly address Black's
d-pawn weakness.}) 23. Nxe5 Nxe5 24. Nc5 {after the piece exchange White's
position is improved, with the strong c5 outpost occupied; note also how
Black's Bf8 is doing nothing constructive. Here perhaps Nakamura expected the
symmetrical ...Nc4 from Black, occupying her own outpost and cutting off the
c-file. However, Harika goes wrong with her next move.} 24... Nf3+ $2 {this
sacrifice must be either the result of miscalculation or desperation on Black's
part.} 25. gxf3 Qg5+ 26. Bg4 h5 27. Nxb7 Rxb7 28. Qxa6 {the key move from
White's perspective. Black must lose a tempo due to the threat and White can
simplify into a favorable position after making some counterthreats.} 28...
hxg4 (28... Rxb4 29. Bc3 Rc4 30. h4 Qxh4 31. Bd7 Rd8 32. Bb5 $18) 29. f4
{another key move for White, keeping the tension of multiple threats.} (29.
Qxb7 $4 gxf3+ 30. Kf1 Qg2#) 29... Qe7 $18 {so White emerges from the sequence
with an extra (passed) pawn and a winning game.} 30. b5 {passed pawns must be
pushed!} 30... Qd7 31. b6 Bb4 32. Red1 Re6 33. Bd4 {note again how Black's
dark-square bishop is not doing anything constructive and how its White
counterpart is helping dominate the game.} 33... Rh6 $2 {this attempt to
generate some threats on the h-file in fact leads to quick victory for White,
as the rook partially blocks an outlet for the cornered Kh8.} (33... Bd6 {would
allow resistance for a while longer.}) 34. Qa8+ Kh7 35. Rc8 Kg6 36. Rg8 Rh7 37.
Qc8 {almost anything wins at this point. A queen exchange would lead to an easy
(for a GM) endgame win, so Nakamura does not mind that possibility.} 37... Qe7
{this leads to a quicker, merciful end.} (37... Qxc8 38. Rxc8 Ba5 39. Ra1 Bxb6
40. Ra6 f6 41. Rxb6 Rxb6 42. Bxb6 $18 {the extra bishop and Black's doomed
d-pawn ensure a White victory.}) 38. Qxg4+ {and mate follows.} 1-0

1. d4 f5 {The Dutch Defense is an opening that often uses alternative
move-orders, especially to reach a Stonewall formation, as seen in Annotated
Game #147 (a Slav Stonewall). Here Carlsen plays very straightforwardly with
the text move. This may have had a psychological element as well, since the
Leningrad Dutch - something Carlsen had played recently and lost with - is a
more common choice and essentially requires Black to start with ...f5.} 2. g3 {
Anand goes for the standard professional-level approach of a kingside
fianchetto against the Dutch.} 2... Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. c4 c6 {a useful
illustration of move-order importance, as White could exchange on d5 with a
slight advantage if ...d5 were played immediately.} 5. Nf3 d5 6. O-O Bd6 {the
defining position of the main line of the Modern Stonewall.} 7. b3 Qe7 8. Ne5 {
Bb2 and a4 (preparing Ba3) are much more popular choices. The text move is the
third most often played and scores well (60 percent) - even better than the
other two moves - but this may reflect the quality of opposition as well. The
drawback of White's choice here is that it does not immediately help his
development.} 8... O-O {Carlsen drew the one previous game he had played in
this line, with the alternate choice of ...b6 (the modern approach to Stonewall
development). While the text move is relatively noncommittal, if Black wants to
play ...b6 and continue his development by getting the light-square bishop out,
the earlier the better.} (8... b6 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. Nc4 Nc6 11. Nxd6+ Qxd6 12.

unnatural, but if White's bishop goes to b2, it will need an unimpeded diagonal
to be of any use, so the "natural" square on c3 is not as good. The knight will
also be able to transfer to f3 and support e5 that way.} 9... a5 { the text
move is not a new idea, but it is still far from the main line ideas. It
appears to have been played to good effect recently by other players, however,
so perhaps that also attracted Carlsen to it.} 10. Bb2 (10. a4 Na6 11. Ndf3 Nb4

more common to have reached this position by first playing the text move, then
a5. The database shows several games by Moskalenko is this line, for example.}
11. Qc2 a4 $5 {Moskalenko's idea, to disrupt White's queenside. This goes
against traditional ideas of the Stonewall, which feature play exclusively in
the center and kingside. However, Black can effectively distract White by using
this approach and perhaps (as in this game) later on generate some chances
himself on the queenside. Black need not fear White simply taking the a-pawn,
as the pawn is not defensible and the capture may cause more problems by
weakening the queenside structure.} 12. Ndf3 (12. bxa4 Ne4 13. Ndf3 Qd8 14. Nd3

standard, strong Stonewall move. White will have to either awkwardly attack the
knight with f2-f3, or exchange it off, in which case Black gets a freer game
from the exchange of minor pieces.} 13. e3 { this seems like a waiting move on
Anand's part, as it doesn't accomplish much for White.} 13... a3 {the pawn

{is an interesting option more in line with standard Stonewall plans for
kingside attacks.}) 15. Nxe5 Bd7 16. Nxd7 {I'm not sure why Anand chose to
exchange pieces here, since it would seem to favor Black slightly. The
centralized Ne5 could then be exchanged by Black, it is true, but White would
then have a strong central e5 pawn.} (16. f3 $5) 16... Qxd7 17. c5 Bc7 18. b4

but it's hard to see any concrete threats as a result of it.} 18... h5 {the
engine agrees this is a strong move, but it's certainly not one a Class player
would think of. Its usefulness becomes more apparent later. Among other things,
it eventually may threaten ...h4 and it also frees up another escape square for
the king.} (18... b5 $5 {is something I might be tempted to go with here. For
example} 19. cxb6 Bxb6 20. Rfc1 Rfc8 $11 {White will find it difficult to make
any progress and Black can think about redeploying the bishop via d8 to e7 or
f6, as well as moving the knight to d6 and then onward.} ) 19. Be1 {the piece
is doing absolutely no good where it is, so a better place must be found.}
19... e5 $5 {Carlsen immediately takes advantage of the relaxing of pressure on
e5 and opens the diagonal for his bishop. Note how effective the a3 pawn
becomes as a result of this.} 20. dxe5 {this is not forced, but otherwise Black
can get some useful pawn play on the e file  (occupying e4 after the knight
vacates it) or support a thematic push of the f-pawn.} 20... Bxe5 21. Rd1 Qe6
{moving the queen off the d-file and the pin, while giving it a better diagonal
and potential mobility along the 6th rank.} 22. f3 {White finally kicks Black's
central knight from its post.} 22... Nf6 23. Bh3 g6 { in this position, it's
now evident that having Black's pawn on h5 helps restrain any ideas of a White
break on g4.} 24. e4 {the logical next step for White in terms of increasing
his activity, especially in terms of pressuring f5. However, the game now
becomes more complicated and Black's open lines are just as good as White's.}
24... dxe4 25. fxe4 Bb2 $1 {this is a great idea, using an interference tactic
to attack the a2 pawn. White, somewhat surprisingly, has no other way of
defending it. The strength of the Black bishop and the a-pawn is evident. White
still has counterchances, however.} 26. exf5 Qxa2 27. Bf2 { shutting down the
discovered check threat.} (27. fxg6 $4 {fails to a discovered check tactic,
with the Qc2 hanging.} Bd4+) 27... g5 {an excellent example of cold-blooded
defense. Exchanging on f5 would just give White more lines into Black's king
position. The h and g pawns both look weak, but White cannot exploit them.} 28.

things defending the 7th rank.} 29. Re6 Ng4 { an aggressive choice.} (29...

diagonal, for example a5-e1.} 21. Qe1 Nd7 {getting out of the way of the f-pawn

this position completely even. Given the semi-closed nature of it and Black's
ability to easily defend the few weak points, this evaluation seems logical. It
is hard to see how White can make any real progress.} 23. Nb5 a6 24. Nxc7 Rxc7

also less cramped.} 25. Ng5 Nf6 {moving back to protect h7 again.} 26. Qa5 Bf7

strange. Neither bishop is happy in this quasi-Stonewall pawn formation.} 27.

practical chances.} 30. Bxb5 axb5 31. Qxb5 Ne4 { threatening the fork on d2. It
is also interesting to compare the two knights; the one on e4 is significantly
more effective, since its counterpart on e5 has all of its penetration squares

point in the game. Black is now able to combine his pieces effectively together

either overlook or discount the possibility of the pawn fork trick Ndxe4, which

additional time by the a3 pawn.}) 13... O-O 14. b4 {in these types of positions
Black appreciates the fact that the b-pawn advance leaves a wake of weakened

kingside. The bishop of course cannot be exchanged without giving White an
attack.} 19... g6 $15 {however, with this simple move, which has no real
drawbacks for Black, White effectively loses a tempo and Black gains the
initiative. The engine has shown a small plus for Black for several moves; at
this point it becomes more evident.} 20. Be2 Qd6 {the queen occupies the best
logical square for the knight currently stuck on the rim (Na7-c8-d6). However,
we will see there are compensations for this.} 21. O-O h5 22. Qe1 Rae8 {this
gets the rook into the game, so at least there aren't two unproductive pieces
on the a-file. However, it could be of more use on the c-file, and eventually
goes there.} 23. Nb1 { Black's space advantage is now obviously seriously
cramping White.} 23... Bd8 24. Rc2 Kg7 {getting the king out of the way of the
rook, so it can go to the h-file. This could also have been played a move
earlier.} 25. Qc1 Rh8 {White now faces a serious problem on the h-file and the
kingside in general, with Black threatening to advance ...h4 and crack open his
position.} 26. f4 $6 {White probably did not want to be squeezed to death and
tries to get some space here. Unfortunately the resulting opening of the
position is better exploited by Black.} 26... exf3 27. Rxf3 Qb4 $17 28. N3d2
Bg5 {the bishop finally gets active.} 29. Nf1 {White's structure at this point
is simply awful, with doubled g-pawns and a backward e-pawn that desperately
needs protection. All White has going for her at this point is the c-file,
which however can be easily challenged by Black.} 29... Rc8 (29... Qxa4 {is
also possible, but pawn snatching is not necessary for Black to further improve
her position.}) 30. Rxc8 (30. Nc3 $5 {would put up stronger resistance.}) 30...

after her next move.} 31... Qb2 $19 32. Qd3 Rc1 (32... Rc2 {would have been my
natural preference, establishing the threat on the second rank, and is still
winning; the text move is more effective, however.}) 33. Nbd2 Rc3 34. Qb1 Qa3

it's hard to see how Black could possibly lose, although White perhaps was
pinning some hope on a sacrificial kingside breakthrough.} 46. Qe2 Nc7 (46...

decides the game.} 48. Rf4 Ne6 (48... b5 { immediately is more effective, as
White cannot stop the next move to b4 and Black puts more pressure on her

1. Nf3 g6 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. c4 Nc6 5. Nc3 {via a somewhat unusual
move-order we have arrived at a Symmetrical English. Black will follow the plan
of using ...e5 to challenge for control of the center and break symmetry, while
White pursues a queenside strategy.} 5... d6 6. O-O e5 {this advance gives
Black a lock on d4 and greater central presence/control via her pawns. On the
other hand, it blocks the Bg7 and creates a hole on d5.} 7. d3 {this opens up
the c1-g5 diagonal for the bishop and also helps restrain a potential future ..
.e4 advance.} 7... Nge7 {the standard place for the knight in this variation.
The knight, if placed instead on f6, would get in the way of both the Bg7 and
the f-pawn, which Black may play to f5 at some point.} 8. a3 O-O 9. Rb1 a5 10.
Bd2 {White's dark-square bishop development in this line is somewhat
problematic, in that there is no obviously good square for it that does not
also get in the way of other pieces. Keeping it on c1 makes no sense, however,
so placing it on d2 is fine and the most common option. There it may also help
control b4 when the time comes to make a pawn break there.} 10... Rb8 11. Ne1
{initiating the standard plan of repositioning the knight to c2, from where it
is able to help White force through the b4 break. This looks awkward at first
glance, but in reality the knight is doing little on f3 and moving it also
opens up the Bg2 to good effect on the long diagonal.} 11... Be6 {Black
similarly has little scope initially for her non-fianchettoed bishop, but there
is a more obvious choice of where to place it. From e6, it can help cover the
hole on d5 in tandem with the Ne7. Black's subsequent push of the d-pawn is
also consistent with the central strategy originally initiated by playing
...e5.} 12. Nc2 d5 13. cxd5 Nxd5 {this recapture is always done with the
knight, otherwise White would gain the advantage of the two bishops after
exchanging with the Nc3.} 14. Ne4 { an uncommon move. Exchanging on d5 with the
knight is more common, as is the alternative Ne3.} 14... b6 {the obvious way to
protect the c5 pawn.} 15. Ng5 Bc8 { naturally Black wants to preserve the
bishop and avoid giving White the two bishops.} 16. Ne3 {a move that
necessarily reflects an understanding of what is happening on the squares g5
and b4. The game is still in the database, which interestingly shows White
scoring over 70 percent in the dozen games available, although the position
seems quite equal (including to the engine).} 16... Nxe3 (16... Qxg5 17. Nxd5
Qd8 18. b4 $11) 17. Bxe3 Nd4 {here Black diverges from previous games, which

(19... a4 $5 {is preferred by the engine. The pawn is tactically defended, as
Qxa4 would be followed by ...Nxe2.} 20. b5 Bg4 21. Nf3) 20. f3 {this is a
committal and seemingly antipositional move by White, who temporarily shuts off
the Bg2 and cuts off the f3 square from the Ng5. However, it's more dynamic
than an alternative like Re1.} (20. Nf3 $5) 20... Bd7 21. Ne4 axb4 $6 {although
Black still has a passed pawn after this trade, having an outside passed pawn
on the a-file would be a greater advantage.} (21... a4 { is now an even
stronger idea than before, since the passed pawn is protected by the Bd7.}) 22.
Bxd4 exd4 23. Qb3 {White correctly is not in a rush to recapture the pawn,
choosing to develop her queen first in an effective manner. } 23... Re8 {lining
up against the undefended e2 pawn and pinning the knight. This also frees up
the f8 square for a bishop retreat.} 24. f4 {interestingly this appears to be
White's only good move. It frees up the Bg2, most obviously, and her other
pieces are already optimally placed.} (24. Qxb4 $2 {this would lift the pin on
the f-pawn, to White's detriment.} f5 25. Nd2 Rxe2 $17) 24... Bf8 ( 24... h6
{would be a prophylactic move, taking away the g5 square from the knight.}) 25.
Ng5 {another example of a patient master-level move. While Black has protected
the b4 pawn, her pawn structure in the center and queenside is shattered and
too vulnerable to protect in the long term. This means that White need not
worry about the material deficit. Instead, she now starts a threat of her own
against the weak f7 square. This threat trumps the previous pin of the knight
against the e2 pawn, which we therefore can say has been tactically broken.}

the pawn on e6.} 27. f5 (27. Bc6 $5 Re7 28. Qxb4 { might be a simpler approach,
regaining the pawn with the idea of pursuing play on the queenside. In the
game, White instead prefers to increase pressure on the kingside.}) 27... gxf5
28. Rxf5 {taking advantage of the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal.} 28... Rc8 {the
best way to improve Black's position. She can't do anything about all of the
air in front of her king, but she can activate the rook on the open file.} 29.
Bd5 {an excellent, master-level move. White increases the pressure on the
diagonal in the most effective way, while the bishop cannot be taken for
tactical reasons.} 29... Qd6 {Black appears to be trying to hold onto the extra
material, in this case the b4 pawn, rather than placing her pieces on the most
effective squares.} (29... exd5 $2 30. Rxd5 {and Black will lose material, due
to the discovered double check threat.}) (29... Qd7 $5) 30. Rg5+ Kh8 31. Be4
{the bishop now needs to be moved, with the tactical threat of discovered check
no longer there.} 31... Rc5 32. Rg4 {exchanging on c5 would just help Black get
her pawn structure in order.} 32... b5 {I'm not sure of the point of this,
which may simply be a waiting move. If so, bringing the rook back to c7 would
create fewer potential problems, as we'll see shortly.} 33. Rf1 {bringing
another major piece into the kingside attack.} 33... Rc3 34. Rf7 { threatening
mate on h7.} 34... Rc7 {now we see why this would have been better played
earlier, as Black is simply a tempo down.} 35. Rf5 {again using tactical themes
involving the e6 pawn. The pawn remains pinned, but this time against the
mating square g8 rather than the Black king.} 35... Bh6 $6 {under pressure,
Black finally cracks. She was probably focused on getting rid of the mate
threat on g8, which is now covered by the Re8. She also probably saw the
threats she could make after placing the bishop on e3, but White is able to
easily parry them.} (35... Rc5) 36. Rxb5 $16 {now we see another drawback of
Black's move 32. She now has no material compensation for her positional
difficulties.} 36... Be3+ 37. Kg2 Qf8 38. Bf3 {shutting down any threats on the
f-file.} 38... Rc1 39. Qxb4 {ignoring the check on g1. This is also a
characteristic of master-level play, as amateurs too often are afraid of
checks.} 39... Rg1+ 40. Kh3 {emotionally these kind of moves can feel awkward
and scary, as the king has very limited squares. However, calculation shows
that Black has run out of threats.} 40... Qf7 $2 {it's not obvious at first
glance why this is bad, although White is able to quickly achieve a won
position. Black does not realize that she has effectively given up control over
the 8th rank.} (40... Qxb4 {is judged best by the engine, although it will
likely result in a winning endgame for White.}) 41. Qd6 $18 {and there is
nothing Black can do to avoid mate or major material losses. The immediate
threat is Qe5+, while the queen can also support exchanging off the Re8.} (41.
Rb8 {is probably the easiest winning continuation to spot, although the text
move is more elegant and decisive. The problem for Black is that her back rank
is under-defended, given the control of the Rg4 over the g-file and Black's
king in the corner.} Qh5+ 42. Rh4 Qf5+ 43. g4 Qf7 44. Qb7 Qxb7 45. Rxe8+ Kg7

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {entering the "Main Line" Caro-Kann, although these
days it's the Advance Variation (3. e5) that is most played at the professional
level.} 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {the Classical Caro-Kann.} 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7.
Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 {the standard position in
this line. Now Black varies, however.} 11... a5 $5 {this appears to be a new
idea. Very little played, but with some recent high-level games where Black
scores well.} (11... Ngf6 {is normally played here.}) 12. O-O-O {this seems to
be an almost reflexive choice by White and scores 40 percent in the database
(the alternative c4 scores 0 percent). The logic is that Black no longer can
castle queenside safely, so by default must have the king stay in the center or
castle kingside. White therefore castles queenside and keeps the rook on the
h-file, for future attacking possibilities. This does in part play into Black's
main idea, however, which is to gain space on the queenside and play there.}
12... Bb4 {this provokes White's next move, which however is not forced. The
move is universally played in the database, an indication that it is considered
the obvious follow-up idea and the reason for playing ...a5 in the first
place.} 13. c3 (13. Ne4 $5 {ignoring the bishop sortie and spending the tempo
on mobilizing the knight is another option.}) 13... Be7 {having done its job,
the bishop returns to its standard square. Now White's king is less secure,
since the c3 pawn is a possible target for a future pawn lever.} 14. Qe2 Ngf6
{at this point we have a standard position, but with c3 and a5 thrown in.
Structurally this has to favor Black a little, but this may be offset by the
tempo invested in the pawn move, unless it is put to further good use.} 15. Ne5
{a standard attacking formation by White, seizing the central square and
freeing up the space in front of the f-pawn.} 15... O-O {while it will take
good defensive (or counter-offensive) skills to protect the Black king, it's
still far better off castled than sitting on the e-file.} 16. f4 Re8 {this is a
standard defensive rook move in this line. While at first glance it may seem
unnecessary, the e6 pawn can become a serious weak point and tactical focus for
White, so the Re8 will help with that, as well as leaving the f8 square
potentially open for a bishop retreat.} 17. Kb1 {this proactively gets the king

1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. a3 {White has many playable options on move
four of the English Four Knights variation. This one is more in the spirit of a
reversed Sicilian, but can also transpose to more standard English positions
(as happens in the game).} 4... g6 {this is a standard English way to develop
the bishop and scores relatively well for Black (around 47 percent).} (4... d5
{ would be the way to directly challenge White, in the style of the Open
Sicilian (reversed). However Black only scores 42 percent in this line.}) 5. d3
Bg7 6. Bg5 {this isn't found in many high-level games and is an accelerated
development of the dark-square bishop.} 6... h6 7. Bxf6 {consistent, otherwise
White loses time retreating the bishop. The game is now already out of the
database.} 7... Bxf6 8. g3 O-O 9. Bg2 Bg7 {the bishop retreats to protect h6
and get out of the way of the f-pawn.} 10. O-O {White now has a rather
standard-looking English position, as does Black.} 10... d6 11. Rb1 {White's
typical plan is to use the b-pawn advance to expand on the queenside and push
the Nc6 away, leaving the long diagonal open for White's bishop.} 11... a5
{Black chooses to (temporarily) challenge the b-pawn advance, rather than move
forward with other development and preparing counterplay on the other wing. The
text move will result in opening the a-file for Black's rook, after the pawn
exchange.} 12. b4 axb4 13. axb4 Be6 14. Nd5 $6 {while it's a key principle of
the English to occupy d5 with a knight when advantageous, it's often difficult
to understand when it is best to do so. Here the knight move is premature, as
it would allow Black to block the long diagonal more effectively.} (14. b5 Ne7
15. Qc2 {is a standard and good approach.}) 14... Qd7 {with the evident idea of
playing ... Bh3 as a follow-up. This is rather slow, however.} (14... Ne7 $5 {

example} 18. bxc6 bxc6 {and it's clear White has no threats, while Black has a
strong center and better prospects on the queenside as well.}) 15. Nd2 {this
now allows the bishop to support the Nd5, which is in a strong position.} (15.
b5 Ne7 16. Nd2 {would also be fine. If the Nd5 is exchanged, White would have
doubled d-pawns, but the strength of the d5 pawn would be compensation for
that.} Bxd5 17. cxd5 $11) 15... Ra2 {not a bad move, but the resulting
continuation is a little awkward for Black.} (15... Ra3 {is the rook move
preferred by Komodo 8. The difference with the text move is that the rook on a3
controls c3 and cannot be challenged by a White knight.}) (15... Nd4 {is
another possibility. The knight otherwise is going to be placed rather
awkwardly after White's b-pawn advance. One sample continution:} 16. e3 Bxd5
17. cxd5 Nb5 $11) 16. b5 Nd8 {essentially forced, in order to protect the b7
pawn.} 17. Nb3 {the idea behind this move is apparently to support an eventual
c5 advance. This eventually comes to fruition, but the knight is nevertheless
not optimally placed.} (17. Nc3 {is the obvious move here, hitting the Ra2 and
clearing the long diagonal for the bishop.}) 17... c6 18. Nb4 (18. Nc3 {is also
still possible.}) 18... Ra8 19. bxc6 bxc6 20. Qd2 {it's sometimes difficult in
the English to figure out the best square for developing the queen. In any
case, it's important to get the rooks connected and maximize the queen's
utility. Here the choice is between d2 and c2. On d2, the queen has open
diagonals (c1-h6 and a5-e1) but it's not clear if they can ever be utilized. On
c2, it might better support the queenside and would leave d2 open for the Nb3.}

kingside going sooner.}) 21. Rfd1 $6 {this effectively loses a tempo for
White.} (21. Bxh3 $5 {an English player needs to know when to exchange the Bg2
like this. While Black's queen always looks threatening on h3, without the
support of a knight or advanced pawns it will be less effective.} Qxh3 22. c5 {
taking advantage of the Nb3's presence} d5 23. Ra1 $11) (21. Ra1 {is another
alternative, challenging the Ra8.}) 21... Bxg2 $15 22. Kxg2 f5 (22... Ne6 $5 {
would get the knight back in the game, connect the rooks and again control c5.}
) 23. c5 {evidently this was the idea behind the positioning of the Nb3.} 23...
d5 24. d4 e4 {Black by this point has a stronger center and more space, so
White needs to turn her attention to trying to contain Black's threats.} 25. f4
{ this can be a key defensive move for White in these position types.} 25...
exf3+ 26. exf3 f4 27. g4 (27. gxf4 $2 Ne6 28. Nd3 Qf7 $17 {and White's
shattered kingside pawns will not provide an adequate defense.}) 27... Ne6 28.
Re1 Ra3 $6 {making this rook more active isn't a bad idea, but again this is
not the best square for it on the a-file.} (28... Ra4 {exerts indirect pressure
on d4 and can't be chased off by a knight.}) (28... Rfb8 $5 {gets the other
rook into the game effectively and illustrates how White's opening of the
queenside can also be a weakness, with Black's rooks looking much better
placed.}) 29. Nc2 Raa8 $6 {this makes the maneuver just a waste of time.}
(29... Ra4) 30. Qd3 ( 30. Na5 $5 {threatening Rb7 is an interesting idea.})
30... Qf7 31. Re2 $11 { at this point White has blunted Black's initiative and
can start manuevering again.} 31... h5 {a good practical move by Black, as
White does not find the best continuation.} 32. h3 $6 {this sort of defensive
move is often instinctual, as it appears more solid than exchanging on h5.
However, in that event White will be the one controlling the g-file, so it's
actually better.} (32. gxh5 gxh5 33. Rg1 $11 {followed by Kh1 and White is
fine.}) 32... hxg4 (32... Qf6 $15 { threatening to penetrate on the kingside,
looks more effective.}) 33. hxg4 Rae8 {this removes Black's possibility of
making threats on the a-file. If Black wants a rook on e8, Rf8-e8 makes more
sense, since the f-pawn is already overprotected.} 34. Rbe1 {White again looks
fine, now that Black's threats have dissipated.} 34... Bf6 $6 {this is too slow
and allows White some initiative.} ( 34... Qf6 $5) 35. Nb4 {now the knight is
not tied to the d-pawn and can make threats of its own.} 35... Nd8 {the only
way to protect the c-pawn without losing something somewhere else.} 36. Rxe8 $6
{this is not forced and is a good example of how it is often better to maintain
tension and even increase it, rather than release it prematurely.} (36. Na5
{would be the most challenging for Black, who would then have to find} Bh4 {to
keep things equal.}) 36... Rxe8 37. Rxe8+ Qxe8 38. Qd2 {at this point the
position looks equal/drawn, so perhaps White simply wanted to head for a draw
earlier.} 38... Ne6 39. Na5 Nxd4 {one of multiple drawing continuations. White
will win the d5 pawn with her queen, but this leaves the back ranks open for
Black's queen to penetrate and give perpetual check.} 40. Naxc6 Nxc6 41. Qxd5+

difficult for Class players to envision, since it weakens the pawn shield in

interesting choice. Basically, if White exchanges the rooks, he technically has
a slight edge, but it's very doubtful he'll be able to do anything significant

the text move, White retains the rook and Kramink evidently still hopes to
squeeze out a win if Black falters.} 27... Ra8 {perhaps this is intended as a
threat to advance the a-pawn, although it doesn't seem very significant.} 28.

maintaining the tension with the b-pawn could eventually lead to a collapse of

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 {the Semi-Slav} 5. g3 {here White goes
with a kingside fianchetto approach, typical of a Catalan-style opening. I also
prefer to play this way vs. a Semi-Slav style setup, although I'm not a 1. d4
player. This is also in effect a gambit approach, since Black can opt (as in
the game) to take and try and hold the c-pawn.} 5... dxc4 (5... Nbd7 {is most
often played here and often signals a desire to keep the central structure and
play for the e5-e4 break eventually.}) 6. Bg2 b5 7. O-O Bb7 8. b3 {this is the
only game in the database with this move; Nakamura is often not afraid to be
experimental in the opening. Most often played is Ne5, focused on targeting the
c6 pawn, but White scores below par (45 percent).} ({Here's one game with a
similar approach, although Nakamura accelerates the idea by a tempo.} 8. Ne5

(2515)-Hautot,S (2360) Charleroi 2015}) 8... cxb3 {here I wonder if this move
wasn't in part driven by psychological factors, as a relatively safe-looking
approach.} (8... b4 {looks the most testing, as Komodo assesses.} 9. Na4 c3 10.
a3 a5 11. Ne5 Nbd7 {and Black looks fine, with the c6 pawn tactially protected,
for example:} 12. Nxc6 $2 Qc7 13. Ne5 Bxg2 14. Kxg2 Nxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5 $17) 9.
Qxb3 {now the game has transposed back to the database, with a very small but
very favorable record for White (75 percent).} 9... Be7 10. Ne5 a6 11. Rd1 O-O
12. Ne4 {an effective move for the piece. The knight on c3 is not contributing
materially to White's game, so Nakamura prepares to transfer it. Bg5 has been
previously played here, with success, but Nakamura prefers to leave that square
open for the Ne4 to move to.} 12... Qc7 (12... Nbd7 $5 {would directly
challenge the Ne5.}) 13. Ng5 {showing the value of targeting the traditionally
weak f7 pawn, even when it is still protected by the Rf8, when the square e6 is
also under attack. This is also a typical tactical theme in the Caro-Kann,
where Black has to watch for sacrifices involving attacks on f7/e6.} 13... a5
(13... h6 $6 14. Ngxf7 Rxf7 15. Qxe6 {and Black has problems.}) 14. Bh3 {we are
still far from the point where forced variations will get White anything.
Nakamura bides his time and is content to engage in a maneuvering battle. Here
e6 is targeted yet again, ignoring the (overprotected) c6 pawn.} 14... a4 15.
Qc2 {at this point the engine shows a slight plus for White. Black cannot have
been too happy with the opening, as evident after the next move, which brings
all the queenside pieces back to their original squares.} 15... Bc8 {a logical
and correct move to protect e6, but it still must have been annoying to have to
do. Black has little dynamic play available and his approach must be to hold
onto the extra pawn and hope White's initiative proves fruitless. Normally
Black would also try to look for a way to give back the material to fully
equalize, for example in the move 17 variation below.} 16. Bf4 Qd8 {the queen
has to move off the b8-h2 diagonal because of the threat of discovered attack.}
17. Ng4 { containing the obvious threat of exchanging the Nf6 and playing Qxh7
mate.} 17... g6 {this weakens the king position and helps make Black's edge
more concrete.} ( 17... Nbd7 $5 18. Be5 h6 19. Nxf6+ Nxf6 20. Bxf6 hxg5 21.
Bxe7 Qxe7 22. Qxc6 Bd7 {and the engine shows equality, but the position looks
much easier for White to play.}) 18. Nxf6+ Bxf6 19. Ne4 Bg7 (19... Be7 $5
{helping cover d6 may have been better, in light of White's 21st move, although
it's understandable wanting to fill the kingside holes.}) 20. Bg2 $16 {the long
diagonal becomes more important to occupy again, now that the sac threat
against e6 is over. The engine's significant plus for White is easy to
visualize here, given White's advantage in development (five pieces to one) and
space.} 20... Qb6 21. Bd6 {a good example of how to exploit better developed
pieces and seize yet more space.} 21... Re8 22. Rac1 Qd8 {moving back to the
original square. Black has to be frustrated by this point.} 23. Bc5 Ba6 24. Bb4
Qc7 {playing defensively around the c6-pawn. But now Nakamura illustrates the
principle of the benefits of opening the position when ahead in development, as
well as highlighting the tactical danger of placing pieces (the Qc7) onto
undefended squares.} (24... Bb7) 25. d5 $1 $18 {this pawn lever effectively
breaks open the position for White's pieces in the center.} 25... exd5 26. Nd6
{ the point being a double attack (with the knight on the Re8 and the Bg2 on
the d5 pawn; the c6 pawn is pinned against the Qc7 and no longer protects d5).}
26... Qd7 {hoping that giving back material (i.e. the Re8) will exhaust White's
initiative.} (26... Rf8 27. Bxd5 Qe7 {moving out of the pin still leaves White
with a big advantage and Black with little he can do about it, for example} 28.
Bg2 Qe5 29. Rd2 Bc8 30. Bc5 Bd7 31. Nxb5 Rc8 32. Nd6 $18) 27. Nxe8 Qxe8 { there
is now less material on the board and the balance is roughly even, but White
still has the far-better developed pieces, so continues to find success by
opening lines in the center.} 28. e4 d4 29. e5 {and the pawn is tactically
protected, as either the bishop or queen taking on e5 would be followed up by
Re1, losing Black material.} 29... h5 {this gives Black an escape square on h7,
but there's little else he can do at this point.} 30. f4 {the pawn on d4 is now
doomed and trying to keep the material balance doesn't help Black.} 30... f6
31. Rxd4 fxe5 32. fxe5 Bc8 (32... Bxe5 $2 {the pawn is still tactically
protected} 33. Re4 $18) 33. Rcd1 {a simple yet powerful follow-up.} 33... Bd7
{Black blocks the penetration of a rook on d8, but now White has too many other
threats, including on g6.} 34. Rd6 Qxe5 35. Qxg6 Qf5 36. Bc3 {a beautiful move
which puts maximum pressure on Black. Now the Bg7 is doomed.} (36. Rf1 {would
be a less incisive but still practical way of winning.} Qxg6 37. Rxg6 $18)
36... Qf7 37. Rf1 Qxg6 38. Rxg6 {and after the bishop goes, White will have a
mate in 5.} 1-0

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. g3 {by far the top choice in the database.
White goes for immediate piece pressure in the center using the long diagonal.}
(4. Nf3 {is the second most popular choice in the database. White avoids
committing to the early fianchetto.}) 4... g6 5. Bg2 Nb6 6. Nf3 {in contrast
with the move 4 variation, White has chased away the Nd5 before her own knight
comes out.} 6... Bg7 7. O-O {retaining maximum flexibility for as long as
possible.} 7... Nc6 8. d3 {White cannot reasonably play d4 here, due to Black's
piece pressure on the center, but this more modest pawn advance releases the c1
bishop and asserts control over c4 and e4.} 8... O-O 9. Rb1 {an interesting
choice by White. Instead of playing a natural bishop developing move, for
example Be3 or Bd2, as a follow-up to the previous move, she prefers to
initiate queenside action immediately.} 9... Bf5 {a somewhat puzzling square
for the bishop, since it's left potentially exposed to harassment by a knight
or by an eventual e4 or g4 push, should circumstances favor that. It is in a
position to prevent Ne4, however, as a minor piece exchange on e4 would then
give Black a 3-2 pawn majority on the queenside.} 10. h3 {this appears to be
aimed at nullifying a potential future Q+B battery on the c8-h3 diagonal, after
which White plays Kh2 to defend h3. White by this maneuver ensures that she
keeps the Bg2 on the board rather than having Black try to exchange it.} (10.
Be3 {alternatively would simply ignore Black's idea of exchanging the bishop,
in favor of development. Play could continue} Qd7 11. Qd2 Bh3 12. Bh6 Bxg2 13.
Kxg2 {and now White will be able to likewise exchange Black's bishop on the
long diagonal, which is at least as valuable as its White counterpart.}) 10...
e5 11. b4 {White presses ahead with her queenside expansion plan.} 11... Nd4
12. Nxd4 $6 {this unnecessarily gives Black a strongly-supported central pawn,
without sufficient compensation elsewhere in the position.} (12. Nd2 $5 $11
{looks a little passive, but it unleashes the Bg2 and keeps White's options
open.}) 12... exd4 13. Ne4 { now White's knight lands on a nice central square,
but it may have been of more use on c3, hitting b5 and d5.} 13... Nd5 {Black
now has a nicely centralized knight of her own.} 14. Bd2 {by this point there
are no real alternative squares for developing the bishop.} 14... c6 15. b5 {an
easy move to play for White, since her main idea, starting with the 9th move,
has been to push the b-pawn into Black's camp. This is a standard minority
attack idea, seeking to undermine support for Black's center.} 15... Qe7 {a
safe-looking choice, although White's next move is also obvious and will help
give her targets on the queenside.} (15... cxb5 16. Rxb5 {and White will have
dynamic play on the queenside, although Black's strengths in the center balance
this, along with the long-term 2-1 majority on the queenside.}) 16. bxc6 bxc6
17. Qc2 { pressuring the backwards c-pawn on the half-open file is now an
obvious strategy for White.} 17... Rac8 18. Rb3 {with the idea of dominating
the open b-file. } (18. Qc5 $5 Qxc5 19. Nxc5 {would be a nice-looking
positional gain for White, occupying c5 with a knight and opening up the long
diagonal.}) 18... c5 { Black correctly looks to advance and then hopefully
liquidate the c-pawn, which otherwise will be a long-term weakness.} 19. Rfb1
{consistent, but it gives Black the opportunity to resolve the situation with
the c-pawn.} (19. Rc1 $6 {would fail to prevent the advance of the c-pawn,
which tactically still works:} c4 20. dxc4 Nc3 21. Bxc3 dxc3 $17 {and White is
cut off from protecting the c4 pawn, which Black will soon be able to take and
thereby restore the material balance, while also having control over the center
and a menacing passed c-pawn.}) 19... Nb6 {this appears to be a turning point
in terms of the initiative. Instead of pressing forward, which is tactically
possible, Black retreats and then focuses her attention elsewhere.} (19... c4 {
and now play is similar to the above variation:} 20. dxc4 ({inserting} 20. Rb7
Qa3 {may be an improved version of the idea for White}) 20... Nc3 21. Bxc3 dxc3
$15) 20. Rb5 {adding sideways pressure against the c-pawn.} 20... Rfe8 21. Bg5
{ White is now the one making threats and forcing Black to play reactively.}
(21. Rxc5 $2 Bxe4 $19) (21. Nxc5 $6 {the pin against the Qc2 will prove awkward
after} Be5 $15 {and now Black threatens simply ...Bd6, also with ideas of
possibly sacrificing on g3 in the future.}) 21... f6 $2 {a very committal move
that is also unnecessary; there are several reasonable queen moves. Blocking
the Bg7 effectively takes away a key piece from Black's game. Although Yip then
moves to undo the block, the whole process leaves her more vulnerable and White
well-positioned to exploit this.} 22. Bf4 Bxe4 23. Bxe4 f5 24. Bf3 { now it's
obvious that White can support an h-pawn advance with her bishops.} 24... Be5
{Black continues to attempt to exchange her way out of her difficulties.} 25.
Bxe5 Qxe5 {it's interesting to see that the minor piece exchanges have had
their desired effect on the kingside, but look at the remaining pieces. White's
light-square bishop is huge, while the black knight is mostly ineffective.
White's rooks are also very active and the c-pawn's weakness is magnified.} 26.
Rc1 Nd7 27. Qc4+ {White's light-square dominance is well illustrated by this
sequence.} 27... Kh8 28. Rb7 Qd6 29. Rxa7 $18 Ne5 {still trying to exchange her
way out of trouble, except now she is material down.} 30. Qd5 { a safe approach
to handling the position.} (30. Qb5 {is the engine's suggestion, but it
involves giving Black some more risky-looking activity, for example} Nxf3+ 31.
exf3 {and Black has the e-file to work with and some potential kingside
counterplay, although it does not work out in calculation, largely because the
c-pawn is too vulnerable to capture.} Qc6 32. a4 $18) 30... Nxf3+ 31. Qxf3
{White's advantage is solid - a passed a-pawn and no real weaknesses, while
Black still has the backwards c-pawn - and Black can do little about it.} 31...
Qb6 32. Rb7 Qe6 {targeting the one slightly weak point (e2) in White's position
and supporting a c-pawn advance...which, however, will be problematic.} 33. Rc2
c4 $2 {this advance comes far too late now and out of desperation.} (33... Qc6
$18) 34. dxc4 {the simplest approach, just take the pawn.} 34... Rxc4 35. Rxc4
Qxc4 {optically it looks like the position is not terribly worse for Black,
with the weak c-pawn now gone, but now her exposed king position can be
exploited by White's queen.} 36. Qf4 $1 {an excellent example of a decisive
queen move that does multiple things. Useful ones include covering c1, getting
on the open b8-f4 diagonal and pressuring the d-pawn. However, the most
important threat is now to Black's h-pawn, which cannot be adequately defended
from the Q+R combination.} 36... Rxe2 {Black desperately tries to distract
White, but to no avail.} 37. Qb8+ Qg8 38. Qd6 { with an unstoppable threat on
the long al-h8 diagonal.} 38... Re1+ 39. Kh2 1-0

1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. Nf3 e5 {breaking the symmetry and
establishing a central pawn presence.} 6. O-O Nge7 {the idea here is not to
block the f-pawn's advance later.} 7. Ne1 {White's idea is to redeploy the
knight via c2. This is slow, but the opening is largely about maneuver rather
than attack.} 7... d6 8. Nc2 {from here the knight can support the b4 advance
or move to e3 to increase domination of the d5 square.} 8... h5 $5 {this move
scores well in the database - although see the next annotation - but is not
often played. There is only one game listed in 2015 with it, for example.}
(8... Be6 {is the more conventional choice, along with castling.}) 9. d3 {both
Komodo and the database indicate that the reaction h4 should be avoided. In the
small sample (19) of games available, it has been played roughly half of the
time and scores badly at 25 percent. That said, White appears to be OK in the
line, although it allows some additional attacking ideas for Black, as in the
following game:} (9. h4 g5 10. hxg5 h4 11. Ne3 hxg3 12. fxg3 Be6 13. Ncd5 Qd7

logical follow-up. If Black is going to advance the h-pawn, she should go all
in.} 10. Ne3 {most played here, although the engine evaluates that first
proceeding with standard play centered around the b-file is fine.} (10. a3 a5
11. Rb1 a4 12. Bg5 f6 13. Bd2 h3 14. Bh1 O-O 15. Ne3 {is one possibility.})
10... Be6 {this gets the bishop out, but Black did not need to develop it this
early, as it is doing fine on its original square for now. It does nothing to
impede White's next move.} 11. Ned5 f6 {this seems a little premature and
commital.} (11... h3 $5 {is the engine's choice, which would avoid White's
later gxh4.}) 12. Qe1 {Yu here is signaling a shift in commitment to a kingside
strategy, placing her queen on the e1-h4 diagonal and preparing her next move.}
(12. Rb1 $5 {would continue with queenside and central play.}) 12... Qd7 13. f4
O-O-O {Melekhina notes the strategic shift and castles on the opposite wing,
making White's threat of expansion on the kingside less urgent.} 14. fxe5 fxe5
$6 {this looks like a logical and "clean" move visually, but immediately gives
White some advantage to play with, including the open f-file and the
initiative. From here on out, the game gets wilder.} (14... Bxd5 $5 { with the
idea of exchanging material and reducing potential White threats.} 15. Nxd5
Nxe5 16. gxh4 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 f5 $11) 15. gxh4 {ugly-looking but effective. Black

does an admirable job of covering the weaknesses and playing actively.} 15...

weaknesses, especially on f7, with the absence of this bishop. White has a
number of ways to take advantage of this.} (15... Bxd5 {is still a good idea,

for White in the database. The point is to transfer the knight to c4.} 11...

obvious move, to ensure the a5 pawn is protected and Black's pieces are not
tied down to it.} 14. Nh4 {intending to go to f5, but the knight ends up stuck
here for a long time before exchanging itself for the bishop on g6.} 14... Rfe8

a7-g1 diagonal and preparing to push the f-pawn.} 15... Bg6 {anticipating the
push g4 and pressuring e4, essentially inviting the following exchange.} 16.
Nxg6 hxg6 {although White now has the two bishops, the individual minor piece
trade is a fine idea for Black. Her light-square bishop was not doing anything
very important and the White knight on the kingside otherwise could effectively
support a pawn advance and/or could go to f5.} 17. f4 {a natural move, but
perhaps White could have taken some more time to prepare it. Black is able to
launch a counterstroke on the queenside.} 17... b5 {the tactics work in Black's
favor if White accepts the pawn sacrifice.} 18. Bxa5 (18. Nxa5 {is inferior, as
the Na5 is out on a limb and its protectors can become overloaded, while Black
has multiple other threats.} exf4 19. axb5 f3 20. Rxf3 (20. Bxf3 cxb5 $15 {and

coordinated as her opponent's and Black can start making threats along the
e-file.} 20... exf4 21. gxf4 Nd5 {a key move in the sequence, as the knight
takes advantage of the pinned e-pawn to use d5 as an outpost and threaten to go
to e3.} 22. Rf3 {defending the e3 square, albeit awkwardly.} (22. b4 $5 {is a
recurring idea in this position that the engines identify. White at least
temporarily gives back the pawn in order to better activate her pieces and
deflect Black's threats. For example} Nxb4 23. Qb1 Nc6 24. Qxb5 Nxa5 25. Rxa5

the pressure and not allow for the advance, as if} 23. e5 $6 Nh5 $17 { and now
the f-pawn is under fire.}) 23. e5 g5 {evidently this was Paikidze's idea, to
pressure the e-pawn by undermining its support. White is faced with some
complex choices.} 24. fxg5 $2 {this was unnecessary and justifies Black's
play.} (24. Qd1 {would get the queen out of the pin first and improve on the
idea.} gxf4 $2 (24... N7b6 25. fxg5 Rxe5 26. b4 Bxb4 27. Bxb4 Nxb4 28. Rxa8

possibilities and Black has to be careful.}) 24... Nxe5 {Black now takes over
the initiative. The two centralized knights in combination with the Re8 and Bc5
can make a variety of threats in this wide-open position.} 25. Rf2 $2 {
preserving the rook in this way just leads to more trouble for White. The
engines suggest a positional exchange sacrifice.} (25. Qg3 $5 Nxf3 26. Bxf3 $17
) (25. Rf1 Ne3 $17) 25... Ne3 $19 {it's clear by this point that for the
investment of a pawn, Black's pieces are now dominating the game. This is a
more positional road to victory.} (25... Nd3 $1 {is even stronger, with a
double attack on the queen and rook. White loses material in all lines, for
example} 26. Bxd5+ Kh7 27. cxd3 Rxe1+ 28. Rxe1 Bxf2 $19) 26. Nb3 {protecting

previous move's idea.}) 29. Qf3 {White has been doing a good job of containing
Black's threats as best she can and the engines show only a slight advantage
for Black at this point.} 29... Qf5 $15 30. Nxc5 {White logically wants to
eliminate Black's strong bishop, but now the Ba5 is hanging. This is a case of
where "doing something" in a position is actually inferior to waiting.} (30. g6

king.} Rac8 31. Qg4 Qxg4 32. Rxg4 Bd6 $15) 30... Qxc5 31. b4 Qf5 $17 {looking
at how the position has transformed, White's bishop is now largely locked away,
although may get back into the action via c7. Meanwhile Black's control of the
e-file and the well-placed Nc4 are key advantages; the Ra8 can also easily get
into the action.} 32. Rf2 Re4 33. Rg1 Rae8 34. Bc7 $2 {an apparently logical
idea, to increase pressure on the f-pawn and have the bishop do something
useful, but now Black's domination of the e-file and her rooks will decide the
game.} ( 34. Kh2 {would protect the h-pawn, which is vulnerable to pressure
along the 3rd rank.}) (34. Qg4) 34... Re3 $1 $19 35. Qxf4 Rxh3+ {a good example
of the principle of looking for tactical exchanges, in this case the f-pawn for
the h-pawn, since White could not take and also protect at the same time.
Obviously the loss of the h-pawn hurts White much more than the f-pawn does
Black, due to White's vulnerable king.} 36. Kg2 Ne3+ 37. Qxe3 {forced.} 37...

White's queen moving out of danger.} 38. Qg3 Rxg3+ 39. Bxg3 Re3 40. Kh2 Qh5+ {a
nice little tactic to pick up the g-pawn and give Black a passed pawn on the
kingside.} 41. Kg2 Qxg5 {White does not have compensation for being down
material (R+B vs Q). It is instructive to see how Black's Q+R combination holds

eventually into a Modern Defense or the like without ...d5.} 3. exd5 cxd5 4.

transpositional alternative, this time to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack.}) 4...

far.} 7... g6 {although not used very often, this variation scores far better
than its more classical counterparts, ...Nxc3 and ...e6.} 8. Qa4 Qd6 {an
interesting choice that requires careful evaluation of the next sequence.} (

Black's compensation for the pawn including the two (outstanding) bishops, play
against the isolated d-pawn, and good avenues for the rooks.}) (8... Bd7 $4 9.

the Black queen, but Black is not really behind in development, as she will
have an easy time getting her bishops out, compared to the Bc1. White's minor
pieces are all forward deployed, but not working together particularly well.
Komodo assesses the position as equal, but White is the one who can misstep
more easily here.} 12. O-O (12. Qd4 $5 {is the engine's recommendation.} Nf6

the Bg7 is now a monster on the long diagonal and White has no real threats. }

of the following sequence.} 14. Nxb7 Bxb7 15. Qb5 O-O {a cold-bloodedly correct
move.} 16. Qxb7 Ndb4 {eyeing the c2 square and restricting the White queen.}

more piece activity, while for White the Bc1 and Ra1 are not playing.} 19. Be2

position with the one on move 11, as all of White's pieces have retreated while
Black's have advanced, and now White is behind in development.} 20... e5 {Black
has an excellent position, but it's not clear exactly what plan is best.
Dominating the c-file looks good, while taking the b2 pawn at this point does
not. In the game, Goryachkina with this move chose to occupy the enter with the
e-pawn. She must have also calculated the next sequence as part of it, perhaps
even playing the text move to encourage her opponent to challenge the Nb4.}

two forward-deployed knights, at the cost of a pawn.} Nxd3 22. Ne1 Nxb2 $15 )

against the Be2 while the Nb4 is hanging.} 22. Bd1 Nbd3 {now the Nb4 has a
place to go and Black is even more dominant. White has no good moves available,
although the engine suggests Ne1 as the best defense.} 23. g3 Nc5 {a "good
enough" type of move that preserves Black's advantage.} (23... e4 {is what the
engine prefers. It would take advantage of the e-pawn's position and launch a
decisive attack. For example} 24. gxf4 exf3 25. Bxf3 Re8 {and the f-pawn will
eventually fall while Black remains dominant positionally. However, this
requires a number of moves to fully unfold and in practical terms it does not
look easy to clearly evaluate the situation at the board.}) 24. Qc4 Nfd3 25.
Bc2 e4 $1 $19 {now the pawn advances to good effect, sacrificing itself to
achieve Black's complete piece dominance.} 26. Bxd3 Nxd3 27. Qxe4 Re8 28. Qa4 {
this immediately lets Black's queen into d5, but White has severe problems in
any case.} (28. Qc4 Rc8 29. Qb3 Re4 {and now the rook can transfer to the

1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 {it's been noted by commentators that Kramnik in
2016 often largely avoided theoretical duels in the opening, in favor of simple
flank opening development early on. This parallels Carlsen's similar practice
of often "just playing chess", a strategy that succeeds when your overall level
of understanding and effort is better than your opponent's.} 3... Bf5 4. O-O c6

other things so that it cannot support f4-f5.} 10. Nf3 {White's last two moves

knows these structures well.} 10... f5 {presumably aimed at deterring the
thematic Leningrad Dutch e-pawn advance, but...} 11. e4 {anyway!} 11... Bxf3 {
an understandable decision to exchange minor pieces, as the bishop is currently
largely locked out of the game by its own pawns on the light squares. } 12.
Bxf3 {nevertheless, the exchange seems to leave White in a good position on the
kingside, with his own bishop now improved.} 12... O-O 13. Nc3 {White at this
point has a clean structure with his pieces working relatively well together.
Black now has a Stonewall pawn structure, but his pieces are not as well placed
or developed.} 13... fxe4 14. dxe4 d4 {this seems overly ambitious. Black
completely gives up his solid central pawn wedge in a forward thrust for space.
It certianly inconveniences White temporarily, but in the longer term it
weakens Black's game.} 15. Nd1 e5 16. Nf2 {Kramnik has plenty of time to
usefully reposition the knight, as Black has to take additional time to shore
up his advanced d4 pawn and get his pieces out.} 16... c5 17. Qe2 {putting the
queen on more useful diagonals and clearing the back rank to connect the
rooks.} 17... Nc6 18. Bg4 {a beautiful place for the bishop. Now the downside
of Black's earlier decisions - to exchange off his light-square bishop and
advance the pawn wedge - is highlighted.} 18... Kh8 19. Be6 exf4 {done in order
to inconvenience and disrupt White's kingside.} 20. gxf4 {here Komodo assesses
the position as completely level, although it seems easier to play as White.

structure, but this time the weaknesses he leaves behind after the g-pawn
advance become more acute.} 20... g5 $6 ({After something like} 20... Qc7 21.

to play c3 in response.}) 5. c3 {White plays it anyway, which eventually leads
to a transposition back to the main line, at least for Black.} 5... Qc7
{placing the queen on c7 this early used to be a quirky sideline. It's now more
mainstream, I'm sure in large part due to its practical success. The main idea
is straightforward, to take over the b8-h2 diagonal and prevent White from
playing Bf4. As the queen wants to go here in most lines anyway, playing it
early and preventing White's bishop from seizing the diagonal makes a lot of
sense.} 6. h3 {this is seldom played. The evident idea is to take away the use
of the g4 square from Black, for either the knight or bishop.} 6... g6 {a new
move in this position according to the database, but not a new idea in the
Exchange Variation. Black looks like he is fianchettoing his bishop, but in
fact the main idea is to play play ...Bf5 and then open the g-file.} 7. Nf3 Bf5

outpost, ready to take back on d3. This also potentially opens up f3 for his
queen.} 8... Nc6 {although this position isn't in the database, for Black it's
a standard setup in the Exchange Variation. In this game, White is further
behind in development than normal, with only two pieces out to Black's four.}

queen again either immediately or after an exchange on e5.} 9... Qb6 (9... Nxe5

Black, though, as a4-a5 is not yet possible.} 14... Ne4 {improving this piece

nowhere else as useful to go.} 16. Bxd6 Nxd6 17. b4 {this type of position is

anticipating the Bd3 development by White and looking to exchange off bishops

Black's kingside pawn structure.}) 6. Nd2 {the second most popular move in the

to f5 seems to take any sting out of it.} Bf5 $11) 9... Bh5 {a relatively rare

exchange off the Bd3, which otherwise is well-positioned to target Black's
kingside.} 10. O-O Bg6 11. Bxg6 {Komodo, in contrast to some other engines,
assesses that it is better for White to not exchange on g6. For White, often
the idea behind this exchange is to create a target for an h-pawn thrust, which
is what in fact occurs later on.} 11... hxg6 12. Rae1 {committing to a
central/kingside strategy.} 12... Be7 $11 {Taking stock of the position, Black
has full equality. The light-squared bishop exchange has left Black solid on
the kingside and White has no obvious advantage, although he can try for play
on the h-file, as in the game. Duda's next move is a novelty in the database
and was likely an attempt to introduce some uncertainty into the position,
while again looking for chances on the h-file.} 13. g3 $146 {as we will see
later, the idea of this move is to prepare the pawn thrust h2-h4.} (13. Ne5 {is
a typical try by White that scores well in the database (67 percent), but
should not objectively be a concern to Black. The database figures also seem to
be skewed by lower-rated games.} Nxe5 14. dxe5 Nd7 {similar to the game
continuation looks fine for Black.}) 13... O-O {no reason to postpone
castling.} 14. Ne5 Nxe5 {Black chooses to remove the well-placed central knight
immediately. Although not forced, this is an excellent defensive idea, as
otherwise White typically starts developing tactical ideas on the e-file to
target the e6 pawn, with a knight sacrifice a possibility later on g6 or f7.}
15. dxe5 Nd7 16. h4 { White follows up on his earlier idea of g3. Should Black
be worried? As the defender in this type of position, the usual assessment is
that after two minor piece exchanges, Black should be all right, since the
sacrificial possibilities by White are limited. White will also need time to
bring his other pieces to bear on the kingside.} 16... Nc5 {puts the knight on
its best square, kicking the queen and eyeing e4 and d3.} 17. Qc2 Qc6 {putting

a light-squared bishop to oppose it is highlighted.} (17... b5 {is what the
engines like in this position, following up with ...Qb7 to put the queen on the
long diagonal and give black the option of a minority attack on the
queenside.}) 18. Re3 { this just ends up being awkward for White and wasting
time. Presumably the idea was to eventually transfer the rook along the third
rank.} (18. Nf3 $5) 18... Qa6 {pressuring the a-pawn and also placing itself on
another useful diagonal.} 19. Qb1 {with this move, it's clear that White no
longer has the initiative and must start responding to Black's threats.} 19...
Rac8 20. Kg2 { needed to clear the first rank for his rook to shift to h1.}
20... b5 {now Van Foreest plays the pawn advance, gaining space and with the
eventual idea of a minority attack along with the a-pawn.} 21. Bg5 Qb7
{although Black has been moving his queen often, each time it has been with a
purpose and has improved his relative position. This time is no different, as
the queen will still be well-placed on e7 after the exchange of bishops, and
the a-pawn is now free to advance.} 22. Bxe7 Qxe7 23. Rh1 a5 24. Qd1 b4
{Black's counterplay on the queenside balances White's play on the kingside.}
25. Qg4 (25. h5 {would amount to the same thing after} bxc3) 25... bxc3 {active
defense.} (25... Qb7 $5 {is another interesting way to defend.} 26. h5 d4+ 27.
Rf3 bxc3 28. bxc3 dxc3 29. hxg6 fxg6 30. Qxg6 Rf5 $11 {and White has nothing
better than a perpetual.}) 26. bxc3 Rb8 {Black again correctly emphasizes
counterplay, threatening to go to b2 with his rook.} 27. h5 g5 {Van Foreest
goes for the option that is equal, but allows him to keep going in hopes of a
win. The correct decision, as it turns out.} (27... Rb2 28. hxg6 fxg6 29. Qxg6
Rxd2 30. Qh7+ Kf7 {is a perpetual for White.}) 28. h6 g6 {this defensive idea
should be well known to Caro-Kann players, to prevent a breakthrough on the
h-file.} 29. Nf3 {targeting the weak g5 pawn, but} 29... Ne4 {holds everything
together for Black. } 30. Re2 {covering the second rank against the threat of
...Rb2. However, this leaves the c-pawn hanging.} 30... Nxc3 31. Rc2 Ne4 32.
Nd4 {although Black is a pawn up, now White gets to have equivalent play for
it, gaining the initiative in compensation. The main threat here is the knight
fork on c6.} 32... Rbc8 33. Nc6 Qa3 {preserving the a-pawn.} 34. Rhc1 Kh7
{another important defensive idea for Black, blockading the h-pawn to prevent a
future sacrifice on h7. The h-pawn is now a long-term liability for White,
especially in an endgame, when Black opening the h-file by capturing the pawn
will no longer be of consequence. Black does have to be careful to manage
potential threats from any occupation of the f6 square by White, however.} 35.
Qe2 {now Black has to take care of his Ne4, which is out of squares after a
White pawn advances to f3. Previously it could have gone to d2, with the
tactical idea of Rxd2 followed by ...Qxc1. The Qe2 instead now covers the d2
square.} 35... g4 {Black gives back the material so his pieces regain freedom
of movement.} 36. Qxg4 Rc7 37. Qf4 {this appears to be a try by White to
maintain winning chances.} (37. f3 {leads to lines where Black can win the
a-pawn, but his queen is too exposed to White's rooks for it to matter, so
essentially White can get a perpetual on the queen.} Nd2 38. Rc3 Qb2 (38...
Qxa2 {doesn't gain Black anything either} 39. R3c2 Qa3 40. Rc3 Nb3 $11) 39.
R3c2 Qa3 $11 {with a repetition of position to follow, whether Black takes the
a2 pawn or not.}) 37... Rfc8 $15 {obvious and good. Now White has to be careful
about the Nc6, which has only one viable square (d4), as well as his currently
under-protected rooks.} 38. g4 $6 {White likely underestimated the consequences
of Black's next move.} (38. Qg4 Qd3 $15) (38. Nd4 {bailing out with the knight
is likely the best (and most practical) option.} g5 {now has much less sting,
since the g4 square is available for the queen.} 39. Qg4 Rxc2 40. Rxc2 Rxc2 41.
Nxc2 Qf8 $15) 38... g5 $1 39. Qh2 (39. Qf3 Qxf3+ 40. Kxf3 f6 41. exf6 Nxf6 {and
the h-pawn will fall after} 42. Nd4 Rxc2 43. Rxc2 Rxc2 44. Nxc2 e5 {first
preventing the knight's return to d4} 45. Ne3 Kxh6 $17 {and Black (at the GM
level) should be able to convert the endgame with his extra passed d-pawn.})
39... Nd2 $19 {using the same tactical idea with the knight move to d2 as
before, but now threatening ... Qf3+. By this point, White is essentially
lost.} 40. Rc3 (40. Qg3 {is objectively better, but still leads to a lost
endgame, so White tries something else.} Qxg3+ 41. Kxg3 Kxh6 $19) 40... Qa4
{the only winning move, threatening the g4 pawn. It's not too hard to find,
though.} 41. Qh5 {protecting the pawn, but now Black's queen dominates in the
center.} 41... Qe4+ 42. Kh3 (42. f3 Qe2+ 43. Kg3 Nf1+ $19) 42... d4 {passed
pawns must be pushed! Now White's position collapses all over the board.} 43.
Rg3 ( 43. Qxg5 $2 Rg8 $19) 43... Qf4 {threatening the f2 pawn as well as ...Ne4
with a double attack on the rooks.} 44. Rd1 Ne4 {an elegant finish.} (44...
Rxc6 { is straightforward, but perhaps required a bit more calculation. Or
Black just preferred winning with the text move.} 45. Rxd2 Rc3 (45... Qxd2 $2
46. Qxf7+ { with a perpetual.}) 46. Rb2 Rxg3+ 47. fxg3 Qf1+ 48. Rg2 Rc2 $19)

follows my path (in Annotated Game #212) of exchanging on e4, rather than
Carlsen's ...Bf5.} 6. Qxe4 Qa5 {now Black diverges from my game, which had ...
Nd7. This is a rather new line, as my database games only go back to 2017.}
(6...Qd5 $5 {is also often played here.}) 7. Bc4 {this would have been
prevented by ...Qd5. However, now we see Black's main idea behind the previous
move.} (7.Qf4 {is the engines' preference.} Qf5 8.Qe3 Qe6 {followed by a queen
exchange on e3 may have been too drawish for Gunina as White, however.}) 7...
Bf5 8. Qe2 e6 (8...Nd7 $5 {would control e5 and develop a piece.}) 9. Ne5 {now
White has a potential sacrifice on f7 and also offers the c2 pawn, a theme that
occurs in some other Caro-Kann lines. Usually the c-pawn is not taken by Black,
because it loses too much time and can give White a strong attack. That is
certainly the case here, given the weakness of the e-pawn.} (9.O-O {was played

Bxe5 {Black considers that the exchange on e5 is better for her, although White
now has the two bishops. The strong knight disappears and development is now
equal.} 12. dxe5 Nd7 13. g4 {it's often difficult to evaluate an early g4 push.
White seems set on aggression and will be looking to gain space and pressure on
the kingside. Of course, now her own king won't be secure either.} (13.Bf4 {
would be a more standard choice.}) 13... Bg6 14. f4 b5 {another thematic
Caro-Kann move, hitting the bishop and with the idea of further queenside
expansion, when possible.} 15. b4 {this in-between move stops a future ...b4,
but allows Black to relocate her queen with tempo to the now under-protected
White kingside.} (15.Bb3 $5) 15... Qd8 16. Bb3 Qh4+ 17. Kd1 (17.Qf2 Qxg4 18.Be3

for Gunina.}) 17... Rd8 (17...O-O-O {looks even better, getting Black's king to
a comparatively safer zone.White doesn't have time to play something like a4,
because of the Nxe5 threat.}) 18. Bd2 h5 $17 {forcing the issue on the
kingside. Now White has to respond.} 19. f5 {White at this point is committed
on the kingside, so might as well press forward.} (19.g5 { doesn't solve
anything, as Black can take her time to further strengthen her position while
White no longer has any threats.}) 19... exf5 20. e6 {Perhaps White's best
practical chance, forcing Black to find the one correct defense. Which,
however, she does.} 20... Nf6 21. exf7+ Kf8 22. Kc1 {breaking the pin. White
has now run out of possible counterplay, though, and Black takes over the
initiative.} 22... Ne4 23. Be1 Qg5+ 24. Kb2 hxg4 $19 {securing the advantage.
Black's passed f-pawn is now huge.} 25. a4 Bxf7 {Goryachkina chooses careful
consolidation to preserve her winning advantage. This also requires good
calculation of the following sequence.} (25...bxa4 {is the engine line, but
that allows White more piece activity and open lines with the light-squared
bishop.}) 26. Bxf7 Kxf7 27. axb5 cxb5 28. Rxa7+ Kg6 29. Qxb5 {White temporarily
restores material equality and has her own pair of passed pawns, but her king
position is too weak and Black immediately exploits this.} (29.Ra6+ Nf6 $19)

the move would eventually be necessary anyway.} 32. Kb3 {nothing better.} 32...

simultaneously pressure the White pawns and harass the White king.} 39. Ka6 Qd4

win with the queens off the board, so would be happy to exchange.} 42. Qd7
